Slot Machines

-Symbols in slot machines have remained relatively unchanged due to the notion that gamblers prefer familiarity
-Because cards and poker were most popular in old saloons, first primitive models of slot machines used these symbols (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades)
-Charles Fey invented the One Armed Bandit, a three reel machine that kept only diamonds, spades, and hearts but introduced horseshoes and the liberty bell (good luck and american freedom, respectively). Soon the number 7 replaced the horseshoe to represent luck as many gamblers thought it as a lucky number
-if you hit three liberty bells, you would get the highest payout
-were in saloons, barber shops, other places
-Because of legal bans, operators created symbols of fruits on the reels, suggestive of chewing gum (which some machines actually dispensed)
-Modern slot machines now have large variety of symbols (some old fruit and card symbols remain)

You need to land successive number of any given symbol/payline to win, however there are some special symbols

-wild symbol: can act as any other symbol
-scatter symbol: does not have to appear on winning line, and with 3 can trigger additional free action
-bonus symbols: ex multipliers, can get a set of these to win lucrative bonus
-stacked symbols: symbol can expand to take up whole reel
-sticky symbols: remain in place for a set number of spins (usually high value)

-Nowadays famous in both casinos as well as online
-”thrill of playing for a potentially life-changing jackpot remains a constant draw for players”

-”In many states, casinos make between 65 and 80 percent of their gambling income from slots”
